# Sectors project

Run docker-compose up in the root to start the database in the docker container.

The extras (dump and index.html) is in the extras folder.

npm start in front directory and run the main application class in back directory to start the front-end and back-end
respectively.

This project is quite unfinished, I ran out of allocated time to properly complete. I mainly was able to get  comfortable with React, Liquibase and Docker and set up bare bones front-end and back-end applications. I also had time to set up the ORM with hibernate.

Front-end is accessible at http://localhost:3000/
